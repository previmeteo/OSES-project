The Open Source Environmental Sensors (OSES) project 
----------

This project, based on the Arduino and Launchpad / Energia platforms, aims to develop an **autonomous and modular station able to collect and upload to the web, in real time or near real time, data acquired by a wide range of environmental sensors**.

The goals of the project are :

- create a modular station on which may be plugged various environmental sensors such as weather and air quality meters
- design an easy to assemble station using low-cost and easy to obtain components and modules
- build an energetically autonomous station, powered by the sun or other renewable energies
- build a connected station which can upload, in realtime or near realtime via GPRS or other long range wireless technologies, data to a web server
- embed a GPS module and a RTC clock in order to know exactly where the station is, and what time is it, when it uploads its data  


Hardware and schematics
----------

The schematics and bill of materials required to assemble the current prototype can be found in the "hardware" directory. 


Code and libraries
----------

The code of the station controller can be found in the arduino-sketch directory. Take also a look at the librairies/librairies-installation.txt for a quick guide on how to download and install the required librairies.
